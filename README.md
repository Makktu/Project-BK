2. Checking the filename for an undesired file extension.

This is where libraries and other 3rd-party tools are useful, but my instinct is to stick with basic vanilla JS as much as possible, for the extra layer of future-proofing and easy maintainability. I find libraries troublesome to deal with. I dislike setting up and cnfiguring npm.
